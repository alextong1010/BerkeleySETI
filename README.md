# BerkeleySETI
This repository contains all my work for the project that I (Yifan Tong) am currently working on with Ann Marie Cody and Daniel Giles at SETI Institute, over the year of 2022.

<b>Folders:</b>
<br><b>Backup</b> - There isn't much here that's necessary, just some backup files in case something goes wrong.
<br><b>data</b> - This folder contains the necessary functions to import the data from our repository (tess-goddard-lcs).
<br><b>inputdata</b> - This folder contains all of the data in the form of csv files that I will be using.
<br><b>messingaround</b> - This folder contains all of the different approaches that I've tried when working on this project, and all of the tangents. You're welcome to check this out to see what other approaches I've tried.
<br><b>Messy-Notebooks</b> - This folder contains all of the non-streamlined notebooks. I commented everything here, so you're welcome to check it out.
<br><b>PhaseFold</b> - This folder contains everything that was part of the phasefold project I did. There's nothing much, but it contains the code for phase folding a light curve.
